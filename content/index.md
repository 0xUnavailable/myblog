## Hi, I’m Mayowa

I study and write about things that I find interesting, some of the things I find interesting are, protocol and protocol design, game theory, security, blockchains and decentralized finance, JoJo's bizarre adventures, Gintama, just to name a few, this list is definitely going to increase in size as I encounter new things and fall into rabbit holes, I am using this blog as a way to express my thoughts on such topics, so expect some atrocious takes.

This site is not a news feed by the way.
