What a time to be alive! We are currently living in the best phase of human history. With recent technologies—AI, LLMs, and constant innovation—the barrier to creation is at an all-time low. This bridges the gap between idea and product. 
Right now, we have LLMs that can churn out thousands of lines of code faster than you can write a hundred; this allows you to focus more on the creative aspect and less on the technical execution.

I am not saying you should go on and create the “Uber for Twitter”—not that crap. Rather, I implore you to play the role of God. Create something **you** define as beautiful. Create something that’s an articulation of your **own** idea. Create something that’s a culmination of your entire personality.

I may see just a chair, but you can see something more. It could be a malformed table, a cloth depot—hell, it can be a work desk. My point is: try and play the role of the sovereign architect at least once. Ignore the "hottest trends." Ignore the AI doom propaganda. Ignore the noise; the noise is only designed to distract you.

So, play God. Be the sovereign architect of your creation. You don’t need permission to create—that’s the whole point. Go on and create something beautiful, and seek peers who will critique your creations, not validate them.
